# express-stream-sample

Install [fyn].

```bash
$ fyn
$ fun start
```

## routes

- `http://localhost:3000` - return streaming response
- `http://localhost:3000?fail=2` - cause a failure on 2nd streaming chunk
- `http://localhost:3000/multi` - send back multiple streams in response

> Note in `multi`, both streams were produced concurrently, so the second one show up in one go after the first one's streamed.
